# Patient Readmission Analysis

A small but thorough analysis of a dataset representing patients of a hospital, their treatments and medical information, and if they were readmitted to the hospital within a certain time period. The goal was to develop a model that could analyze a patient's information and then determine if they would be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days or not.

The process involved an initial data exploration by taking a look at how independent the features of the dataset were. Then I cleaned the data by removing redundant columns and replacing missing values with appropriate placeholders. I experimented with different predictive models including K-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes model, and a basic Neural Network. The final model I used was a Random Forest tree model, which offered the best accuracy and most significant information.
